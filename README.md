[`mendhak/http-https-echo`](https://hub.docker.com/r/mendhak/http-https-echo) is a Docker image that can echo various HTTP request properties back to client, as well as in the Docker container logs.
You can use your own certificates, choose your ports, decode JWT headers and filter out certain paths.

![browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mendhak/docker-http-https-echo/master/screenshots/screenshot.png)

This image is executed as non root by default and is fully compliant with Kubernetes or Openshift deployment.

Please do not use the `:latest` tag as it will break without warning, use a specific version instead.

## Basic Usage

Run with Docker

    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 --rm -t mendhak/http-https-echo:23

Or run with Docker Compose

    docker-compose up

Then, issue a request via your browser or curl, and watch the response, as well as container log output.

    curl -k -X PUT -H "Arbitrary:Header" -d aaa=bbb https://localhost:8443/hello-world


## Choose your ports

You can choose a different internal port instead of 8080 and 8443 with the `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTPS_PORT` environment variables.

In this example I'm setting http to listen on 8888, and https to listen on 9999.

     docker run -e HTTP_PORT=8888 -e HTTPS_PORT=9999 -p 8080:8888 -p 8443:9999 --rm -t mendhak/http-https-echo:23


With docker compose, this would be:

    my-http-listener:
        image: mendhak/http-https-echo:23
        environment:
            - HTTP_PORT=8888
            - HTTPS_PORT=9999
        ports:
            - "8080:8888"
            - "8443:9999"


## Use your own certificates

Use volume mounting to substitute the certificate and private key with your own. This example uses the snakeoil cert.

    my-http-listener:
        image: mendhak/http-https-echo:23
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
            - "8443:8443"
        volumes:
            - /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem:/app/fullchain.pem
            - /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key:/app/privkey.pem



## Decode JWT header

If you specify the header that contains the JWT, the echo output will contain the decoded JWT.  Use the `JWT_HEADER` environment variable for this.

    docker run -e JWT_HEADER=Authentication -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 --rm -it mendhak/http-https-echo:23


Now make your request with `Authentication: eyJ...` header (it should also work with the `Authentication: Bearer eyJ...` schema too):

     curl -k -H "Authentication: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c" http://localhost:8080/

And in the output you should see a `jwt` section.

## Disable ExpressJS log lines

In the log output set the environment variable `DISABLE_REQUEST_LOGS` to true, to disable the specific ExpressJS request log lines. The ones like `::ffff:172.17.0.1 - - [03/Jan/2022:21:31:51 +0000] "GET /xyz HTTP/1.1" 200 423 "-" "curl/7.68.0"`.  The JSON output will still appear.

    docker run --rm -e DISABLE_REQUEST_LOGS=true --name http-echo-tests -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -t mendhak/http-https-echo:23


## Do not log specific path

Set the environment variable `LOG_IGNORE_PATH` to a path you would like to exclude from verbose logging to stdout.
This can help reduce noise from healthchecks in orchestration/infrastructure like Swarm, Kubernetes, ALBs, etc.

     docker run -e LOG_IGNORE_PATH=/ping -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 --rm -t mendhak/http-https-echo:23


With docker compose, this would be:

    my-http-listener:
        image: mendhak/http-https-echo:23
        environment:
            - LOG_IGNORE_PATH=/ping
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
            - "8443:8443"


## JSON payloads and JSON output

If you submit a JSON payload in the body of the request, with Content-Type: application/json, then the response will contain the escaped JSON as well.

For example,

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"a":"b"}' http://localhost:8080/

Will contain a `json` property in the response/output.

        ...
        "xhr": false,
        "connection": {},
        "json": {
            "a": "b"
        }
    }

## Send an empty response

You can disable the JSON output in the response by setting the environment variable `ECHO_BACK_TO_CLIENT`. For example,

```bash
docker run -e ECHO_BACK_TO_CLIENT=false -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 --rm -t mendhak/http-https-echo:23
```

## Custom status code

Use `x-set-response-status-code` to set a custom status code. 

You can send it as a header:

```bash
curl -v -H "x-set-response-status-code: 401" http://localhost:8080/
```

You can send it as a querystring parameter:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/some/path?x-set-response-status-code=401
```

That will cause the reponse status code to be:

```
 HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

## Add a delay before response

Use `x-set-response-delay-ms` to set a custom delay in milliseconds.  This will allow you to simulate slow responses. 

You can send it as a header:

```bash
curl -v -H "x-set-response-delay-ms: 6000" http://localhost:8080/
```

You can send it as a querystring parameter: 

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080/some/path?x-set-response-delay-ms=6000
```

## Only return body in the response

Use the query-string parameter, `response_body_only=true` to get just the request body in the response, none of the associated metadata.
You may use the `content_type` query-string parameter to specify a `Content-Type` for the response.

```bash
curl -s -k -X POST -d 'cauliflower' http://localhost:8080/a/b/c?response_body_only=true&content_type=application%2Fzip
```

The output will be 'cauliflower'.

## Building

    docker build -t mendhak/http-https-echo .

Run some tests to make sure features are working as expected.

    ./tests.sh

To create a new image on Docker Hub, I need to create a tag and push it.

    git tag -s 16
    git push --tags
